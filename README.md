# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

Maria, a lead analysist for a local school district, is analyzing the city schools testing proficiency. The purpose of this analysis is to find trends in school spending, type, and size against student reading and math scores. But now, the school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the ```students_complete.csv``` file shows evidence of academic dishonesty with reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. The challenge is to analyze the data without the Thomas High School ninth graders scores by omitting them. The analysis is repeated and a summary of how the changes affected the previous results.
